# Python_Projects
This is a repo of ALL the freeCodeCamp python projects I have worked on while working through the curriculum.


## Projects
1. Caesar & Vigenere Cipher (I decided to keep these two together in the file, will be adding more, and trying to make it look nicer as I learn more Python)
2. Card Validator (Tells you whether or not a given credit credit number is valid according to the Luhn Cipher)
3. Expense Tracker (Basic Expense Tracker using python)
