# Python_Projects
This is a repo of ALL the freeCodeCamp python projects I have worked on while working through the curriculum.


## Projects
**Bolded projects are certification Projects**

1. Caesar & Vigenere Cipher (I decided to keep these two together in the file, will be adding more, and trying to make it look nicer as I learn more Python)
2. Card Validator (Tells you whether or not a given credit credit number is valid according to the Luhn Cipher)
3. Expense Tracker (Basic Expense Tracker using python)
4. Case Converter (Takes a string in Camel or Pascal case, and converts it to snake case using List Comprehension)
5. Bisection Method Square Root finder (Uses the Bisection Method to find the Square Root of a number)
6. **Arithmetic Formatter**
