# Python_Projects
This is a repo of ALL the freeCodeCamp python projects I have worked on while working through the curriculum.


## Projects
**Bolded projects are certification Projects**

## Scientific Computing With Python - Part 1
1. Caesar & Vigenere Cipher (I decided to keep these two together in the file, will be adding more, and trying to make it look nicer as I learn more Python)
2. Card Validator (Tells you whether or not a given credit credit number is valid according to the Luhn Cipher)
3. Expense Tracker (Basic Expense Tracker using python)
4. Case Converter (Takes a string in Camel or Pascal case, and converts it to snake case using List Comprehension)
5. Bisection Method Square Root finder (Uses the Bisection Method to find the Square Root of a number)
6. **Arithmetic Formatter**
## Scientific Computing With Python - Part 2
1. Password Generator
2. Shortest Path Algorithm
3. Tower of Hanoi - Iterative and Recursive - I decided to have these in two separate files so either version can be used independently.
4. Merge Sort Algorithm - Sorts list using Merge Sort Algorithm
5. **Time Calculator** Takes time and time to be added in hours and minutes + optional day of the week to start on, and returns the time added to the original date, with the correct day of the week
## Scientific Computing With Python - Part 3
1. Sudoku Solver
2. Binary Search Tree
3. **Budget App**
## Scientific Computing With Python - Part 4
1. Vector Space
2. Equation Solver
3. **Polygon Calculator**

## Scientific Computing With Python - Part 5
1. Trajectory Calculator
2. **Probability Calculator**
